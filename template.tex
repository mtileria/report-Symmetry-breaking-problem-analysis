\begin{abstract}


Symmetry Breaking is a well-studied problem in distributed computing. A distributed system presents a symmetry when all processes share the same state. The goal of symmetry breaking algorithms is to break the state of equilibrium of a distributed system before the start of a computation task. The primary objective of this dissertation is to empirically analyse the time and message complexity of distributed symmetry breaking algorithms on synchronous systems, in particular, the Maximal Independent Set problem. The secondary goal is to study how the properties of network topology change in each step of the synchronous algorithm. Three types of synchronisation techniques are used to simulate a synchronous system over an asynchronous message passing system. Alpha and Beta are two well-known synchronizers used in the simulation that requires all process participate in each round. Besides this two techniques, a global simulation adapted to dynamic networks was tested. A simulator developed in Elixir was built to implement the algorithm using the synchronisation techniques mention before. The experimental results are consistent with theoretical lower bounds of the studied algorithm in time and message complexity. The values obtained from the different simulations show a big difference in messages overhead generated by the three techniques, being the global synchronizer the one with less overhead. The global simulation requires additional message to communicate with a master process and to update the topology before the start of each round. However, the measures indicate that the saving in messages not sent by inactive processes is much greater than the cost of sending messages by the entire topology in all rounds.
% Additionally, a simple optimisation to the \textbf{MIS} algorithm is proposed to improve the messages send by processes per round.
