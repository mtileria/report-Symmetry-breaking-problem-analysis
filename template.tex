\begin{abstract}

A distributed system presents a symmetry when all processes share the same state. The purpose of symmetry breaking algorithms is to break the state of equilibrium of a distributed system before the start of some computation. The primary goal of this dissertation is to analyse the time and message complexity of a distributed Symmetry Breaking algorithm on synchronous systems, in particular, the Maximal Independent Set (\textit{MIS}) problem. The secondary goal is to study the convergence properties of the \textit{MIS} algorithm in each round of the synchronous algorithm. The implementation of synchronous algorithms requires additional messages to keep the processes synchronised. Three types of synchronisation techniques were implemented to simulate a synchronous system over an asynchronous message passing system. Alpha and Beta are two simple, well-known synchronizers that require all processes to send messages in each round. Additionally, a global synchronizer adapted to dynamic networks was used in the simulation. In the global synchronizer, one process controls the system synchronisation and only active processes send messages in the rounds.A simulator developed in Elixir was built to implement the algorithm and the synchronisation techniques mention before. The experimental results are consistent with theoretical bounds of the studied algorithm regarding time and message complexity. The values obtained from the different simulations show a big difference in messages overhead generated by the three techniques, being the global synchronizer the one with best performance. The global simulation requires additional messages to update the topology before the start of each round. However, the measures indicate that the saving in not send unnecessary messages by inactive processes is much greater than the additional cost of calculating the active topology in each round. The network topologies for testing were generated using the Stochastic Block model with assortative grouping. The analysis of the graph components suggest that edges are removed very fast in a increasing rate until the graph is composed only of small disconnected components. In general, in the third round the graph reaches the maximum diameter and then start to decrease until the algorithm terminates.
