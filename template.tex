 Symmetry Breaking is a very well study problem in distributed computing. A distributed system present a symmetry when all processors share the same state. The aim of symmetry breaking is to break the equal state between the processes to perform some computation. In this project, randomized synchronous algorithm  are used to study this problem. The objective of this dissertation is to analyse time and message complexity of distributed algorithms for the Maximal Independent Set problem, which is one of the most important symmetry breaking problems. Three types of synchronization techniques were used to simulate a synchronous system over an asynchronous message passing system. A simulator develop in the Elixir Actor model was built in order to analyse the problem using different synchronizations techniques. The results of the simulation show that ..... and present the trade off among the synchronization techniques.... blabla
