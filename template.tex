Breaking symmetry is a very well study problem in distributed computing. A distributed system is composed of nodes with an initial state, possibly the same for every node and a set of edges between the nodes. The aim of symmetry breaking is to break the initial state of symmetry between the nodes to perform some computation. Synchronous algorithm provides an easy mechanism to design and study protocols. The objective of this dissertation is to simulate a synchronous message passing system and analyse time and message complexity of the Maximal Independent Set problem, which is one of the most important breaking symmetry problem. To simulate the synchronous message passing system, three types of synchronization techniques are used and an analysis of the trade off between these techniques is presented. A simulator build in Elixir using the actor model was developed to test the MIS algorithm with different synchronizations techniques. TO BE COMPLETE AFTER TESTS
